Our Project is about Concurrent fault simulation in VLSI testing and validation.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a code for Concurrent Fault Simulation (CFS) algorithm. The code aims to generate a set of test vectors capable of detecting all possible single stuck-at faults present in a combinational circuit. Additionally, we will calculate the collapsed fault set, collapsed ratio, fault coverage at each step, and the sets of detected and undetected faults. In this report, we will first examine all the modules that we have written for this code and then present some experimental and testing results.
